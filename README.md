# Leaflet Quick Start

I'm going through [this tutorial](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html).

I've noticed a few things that seem out of date.
* Leaflet doesn't tell you that you need an API token, but I did.
* When getting the tiles I changed `v3` to `v4`.
* See [this commit](https://github.com/bjmfactory/leaflet/commit/4eea2a8b462194e3ddce54a3f03230d51c2d342a) for the code.
